# BroFire-IoT-Project
**BroFire** is an IoT-based home automation project that allows wireless control of room lights and fans using the Blynk Cloud. By connecting appliances to the NodeMCU ESP8266, users can control them remotely through the Blynk app. This setup enhances convenience by enabling real-time monitoring and control of devices from anywhere.
